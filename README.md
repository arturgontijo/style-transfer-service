This service uses convolutional neural networks to transfer the style of a "style image" to a "content image".

This repository was forked from [xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style). The original code is written in Lua (using torch). It has been integrated into the SingularityNET using Python 3.6.
